                    <p>Retrogaming, also known as classic gaming and old school gaming, is the current playing and collection of 
                        obsolete personal computers, consoles, and video games. Usually, retrogaming is based upon systems that are
                         outmoded or discontinued, although ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via ports 
                         or compilations. It is typically for nostalgia, preservation, or authenticity. A new game could be retro 
                         styled, such as an RPG with turn-based combat and pixel art in isometric camera perspective.</p>
