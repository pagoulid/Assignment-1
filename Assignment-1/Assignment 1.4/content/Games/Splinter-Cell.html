                    <p>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a series of stealth action-adventure video games, the first of which was released in 2002, and their 
                        tie-in novels that were endorsed by Tom Clancy. The protagonist, Sam Fisher, is a highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops
                         sub-division within the NSA, dubbed "Third Echelon". The player controls Fisher to overcome his adversaries in levels 
                        (created using Unreal Engine and emphasising light and darkness as gameplay elements). </p>
