The Legend of Zelda is a high fantasy action-adventure video game 
franchise created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.
The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy, elf-like ears; and Princess Zelda, 
a magical princess that is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, 
an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, 
a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that created Hyrule to remake the world in his own dark image.
 When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user desires; however,
 if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage and Wisdom attempts 
to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.
