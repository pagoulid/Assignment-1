Metroid is a 2D action platformer. Unlike other platformers in which there are several levels with defined start and end points, 
the entire world is large and open-ended, with players free to access new areas and return to old ones as they see fit.

Though Samus starts off with only the ability to jump and a weak, short-ranged weapon, she can improve her abilities by finding various
 upgrades scattered throughout planet Zebes, such as the Long Beam to improve her weapon's range and the Morph Ball to access small
 tunnels.

Should the player achieve either of the latter two endings in the NES version, they will be able to restart the game with Samus 
outside of her Power Suit and all upgrades they previously had (excluding Energy and Missile Tanks). 
The difference, however, is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect regular gameplay.

The magazine also named Metroid called it the fifth-best game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in its Best of the Best feature, 
describing it as a combination of Super Mario Bros.'s platforming and The Legend of Zelda's exploration and character upgrades.
