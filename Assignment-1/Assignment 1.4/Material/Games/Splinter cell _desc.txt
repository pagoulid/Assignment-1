Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a series of stealth action-adventure video games, the first of which was released in 2002, and their 
tie-in novels that were endorsed by Tom Clancy. The protagonist, Sam Fisher, is a highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops
 sub-division within the NSA, dubbed "Third Echelon". The player controls Fisher to overcome his adversaries in levels 
(created using Unreal Engine and emphasising light and darkness as gameplay elements). All the console and PC games in the series 
were positively received, and the series is commercially successful. 
The series was once considered to be one of Ubisoft's flagship franchises, selling more than 31 million copies by 2011. However, as of
 2022 there has not been a new installment since 2013, though a VR version and a remake have been announced.
