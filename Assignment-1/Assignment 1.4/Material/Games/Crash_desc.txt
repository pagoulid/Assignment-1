Crash Bandicoot is a 1996 platform video game developed by Naughty Dog and 
published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game's premise chronicles the creation of the titular 
Crash, a bandicoot who has been uplifted by the mad scientist Doctor Neo Cortex. The story follows Crash as he aims to 
prevent Cortex's plans for world domination and rescue his girlfriend Tawna, a female bandicoot also created by Cortex.
The game is played from a third-person perspective in which the camera trails behind Crash, though some levels showcase 
forward-scrolling and side-scrolling perspectives.
