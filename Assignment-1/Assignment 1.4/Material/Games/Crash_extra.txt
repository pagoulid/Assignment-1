Originally, when Naughty Dog decided that they wanted to focus their game on a character inspired by Taz the Tasmanian Devil from the 
Looney Tunes show, the character they had in mind was a wombat.
Crash would actually have been called Willie the Wombat, but thankfully the creators ended up stumbling across a bandicoot in
 an Australian wildlife guide and the decision was changed.


While Crash Bandicoot is intended to be fun for the family, it cannot be denied that there are many levels that are actually 
incredibly difficult, with the need for perfectly timed jumping being high.
While this may frustrate many gamers, for others it is a whole host of fun, yet even the developers drew the line with one particular 
level, called Stormy Ascent, which ended up being deleted.
The level was so tricky and tough, as a step up from the also difficult Slippery Climb level, that the developers decided to 
simply get rid of it.


There are actually no apples within the Crash Bandicoot world, despite what people may think.
When you crash through a box and see some fruit, which Crash has an unbelievable appetite for, most people have presumed that they are
 apples, however, they are actually called Wumpa fruits.

When Naughty Dog made the decision to create a girlfriend for Crash Bandicoot, they decided to take inspiration from Pamela Anderson for
 some reason, and because of that, her original look was totally inspired by her.
