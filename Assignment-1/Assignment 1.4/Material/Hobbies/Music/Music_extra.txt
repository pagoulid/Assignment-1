hymns build group identity in houses of worship
love songs help prospective partners bond during courtship
lullabies enable parents and infants to develop secure attachments


		It can lead to better learning
Doctors at Johns Hopkins recommend that you listen to music to stimulate your brain. Scientists 
know that listening to music engages your brain — they can see the active areas light up in MRI scans.

people were more motivated to learn when they expected to listen to a song as their reward.



		It can improve memory
Music also has a positive effect on your ability to memorize.

In one studyTrusted Source, researchers gave people tasks that required them to read and then recall short lists of words. 
Those who were listening to classical music outperformed those who worked in silence or with white noise.

The same study tracked how fast people could perform simple processing tasks — matching numbers to geometrical shapes —
 and a similar benefit showed up. Mozart helped people complete the task faster and more accurately


			It can help lower anxiety
