When Eli (Denzel Washington) first sits in the room in which Carnegie (Gary Oldman) imprisons him, a poster of the movie A Boy and
 His Dog (1975) is visible. A Boy and His Dog (1975) is recognized as one of the earliest post-apocalyptic movies, 
and a source of inspiration for many dystopian and post-apoctalyptic movies and video games.

Eli's speech before he fights Carnegie's men in the bar is taken from Genesis 3:17-19, 
where God expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.

In Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, Eli can be a variant on the name of God. The suffix "i" indicates first person singular possession,
 i.e., "my El" or "my God." Also in Turkish, Eli means "his/her hand".

In the cave scene with Eli explains to Solara that the sun came through the sky to the Earth, 
referencing the depletion of the ozone layer caused by the war.
