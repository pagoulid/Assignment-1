                        When Samantha is helping Theo at work with proof-reading of some letters she says ".. but I'm not much of a poet so I think I might 
                        have messed them up a bit". This may be a reference to an Alan Turing paper on Computing and Artificial Intelligence in which 
                        he proposes a possible test of a computer's intelligence by posing questions which the computer answers.

                        Most of the city backgrounds, especially the ones featuring skyscrapers, are actually filmed in Shanghai.
                        You can see many very identifiable skyscrapers such as the Shanghai World Financial Center. There are even Chinese 
                        signs if you look carefully.

                        Several scenes included fictional video games; these sequences were developed by animation artist David OReilly.
                        His work on the film inspired him to explore developing his own video games, eventually leading to his first title, Mountain.

                        The airplane sculpture shown in a square outside Pacific Design Center was entirely made in CGI. 
                        There's no such sculpture on the real location in West Hollywood.
