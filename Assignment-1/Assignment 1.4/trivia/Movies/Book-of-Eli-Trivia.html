                        When Eli (Denzel Washington) first sits in the room in which Carnegie (Gary Oldman) imprisons him, a poster of the movie A Boy and
                        His Dog (1975) is visible. A Boy and His Dog (1975) is recognized as one of the earliest post-apocalyptic movies, 
                        and a source of inspiration for many dystopian and post-apoctalyptic movies and video games.

                <li>
                    <p>
                        In Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, Eli can be a variant on the name of God. The suffix "i" indicates first person singular possession,
                        i.e., "my El" or "my God." Also in Turkish, Eli means "his/her hand".
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In the cave scene with Eli explains to Solara that the sun came through the sky to the Earth, 
                        referencing the depletion of the ozone layer caused by the war.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <p>
                        Eli's speech before he fights Carnegie's men in the bar is taken from Genesis 3:17-19, 
                        where God expels Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.
