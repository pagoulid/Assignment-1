                        While the movie is based on the events described in the book by Matt Bondurant, the timeline and sequence of the actual events found 
                        in the book differs from what is portrayed in the film. This doesn't hurt the film in any way.

                        Tom Hardy and Noah Taylor play rivals in Peaky Blinders, which is also centered around gangsters in the early 20th Century and 
                        also features music by Nick Cave, this movie's screenwriter and composer.

                        The movie is based on actual events, as explained in the 2008 book "The Wettest County in the World" written by Matt Bondurant,
                        grandson of Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf's character in the film).

                        Tom Hardy's character was originally supposed to be slimmer but Hardy had to bulk up for the movie "The dark knight rises"
