                        The knife that Paul Rudd's character uses is called a Bowie knife. Named after the 19th-century American pioneer James 
                        "Jim" Bowie for whom it was created, the director, Duncan Jones' famous singer father, David Bowie actually took his 
                        stage name from him/it.

                        The opening music to the film is an orchestral arrangement (by Philip Glass) of the song 'Heroes', originally written and performed 
                        by David Bowie as part of his "Berlin trilogy" of albums. David Bowie is director Duncan Jones' 
                        father.
