                        According to a study by Stanford University School of Medicine, jogging is effective in increasing human lifespan, and 
                        decreasing the effects of aging, with benefits for the cardiovascular system. Jogging is useful for fighting obesity and
                        staying healthy.
                        The National Cancer Institute has performed studies that suggest jogging and other types of aerobic exercise can reduce the risk of lung,
                        colon, breast and prostate cancers, among others. It is suggested by the American Cancer Society that jogging for at least 30 minutes 
                        five days a week can help in cancer prevention

                        Jogging may also be used as a warm up or cool down for runners, preceding or following a workout or race. 
                        It is often used by serious runners as a means of active recovery during interval training. For example, a runner who completes a fast 400 meter repetition at a sub-5-minute mile 
                        pace (3 minute km) may drop to an 8-minute mile jogging pace (5 minute km) for a recovery lap.
                        Jogging can be used as a method to increase endurance or to provide a means of cardiovascular exercise but with 
                        less stress on joints or demand on the circulatory system.

                        Jogging  prevents muscle and bone damage that often occurs with age, improves heart performance and blood circulation and assists in 
                        preserving a balanced weight gain.
                        A Danish study released in 2015 reported that "light" and "moderate" jogging were associated with reduced mortality compared to 
                        both non-jogging and "strenuous" jogging. The optimal amount per week was 1 to 2.4 hours, the optimal frequency was less than or equal 
                        to 3 times per week and the optimal speed was "slow" or "average".

                        The word jog originated in England in the mid-16th century.The etymology of the word is unknown, but it may be related to shog 
                        or have been a new invention. In 1593, William Shakespeare wrote in Taming of the Shrew, "you may be jogging whiles your boots are 
                        green". At that point, it usually meant to leave.
