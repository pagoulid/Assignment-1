                        Music can improve memory
                        Music also has a positive effect on your ability to memorize.
                        Researchers gave people tasks that required them to read and then recall short lists of words. 
                        Those who were listening to classical music outperformed those who worked in silence or with white noise.
                        The same study tracked how fast people could perform simple processing tasks — matching numbers to geometrical shapes —
                         and a similar benefit showed up. Mozart helped people complete the task faster and more accurately

                        Music can help lower anxiety
                        There’s lots of evidence that listening to music can help calm you in situations where you might feel anxious.
                        StudiesTrusted Source have shown that people in rehab after a stroke are more relaxed once they’ve listened to music for an hour.
                        Similar studiesTrusted Source indicate that music blended with nature sounds help people feel less anxious. Even people facing 
                        critical illnessTrusted Source feel less anxiety after music therapy.

                        Music can lead to better learning
                        Doctors at Johns Hopkins recommend that you listen to music to stimulate your brain. Scientists 
                        know that listening to music engages your brain — they can see the active areas light up in MRI scans.
                        Researchers now know that just the promise of listening to music can make you want to learn more. In one 2019 study,
                        people were more motivated to learn when they expected to listen to a song as their reward.

                        Music remains a powerful way of uniting people:
                        national anthems connect crowds at sporting events
                        protest songs stir a sense of shared purpose during marches
                        hymns build group identity in houses of worship
                        love songs help prospective partners bond during courtship
                        lullabies enable parents and infants to develop secure attachments
