                        Retrogaming is recognized by museums worldwide. For example, the RetroGames arcade museum of Karlsruhe, 
                        Germany was founded in 2002 and the Computerspielemuseum Berlin was founded in 1997. 
                        Some classical art museums bear a video gaming retrospective, as with 2012's Smithsonian American Art
                         Museum exhibition titled The Art of Video Games or as part of the Museum of Modern Art "Applied Design"
                          exhibition in 2013. Starting in 2015, The Strong National Museum of Play adds games annually to the World
                           Video Game Hall of Fame. In 2016, the first museum dedicated solely to the history of the videogame 
                           industry, The National Videogame Museum, was opened in Frisco, Texas.

                        Retrogaming may involve classic game systems being emulated on modern hardware. It bypasses the need to collect
                         classic consoles and original games. Read-only memory (ROM) files are copied by third parties, directly from
                          the original media. They are then typically put online through file sharing sites.They are often sold as
                           re-releases, typically in compilations containing multiple games running on emulation software.
                           The accessibility of emulation popularized and expanded on retrogaming.

                        Vintage retrogaming can involve collecting original cartridge and disc media and arcade and console hardware, 
                        which can be expensive and rare. Most are priced lower than their original retail prices.
                        The popularity of vintage retrogaming has led to counterfeit media, which generally lack collectible 
                        value
