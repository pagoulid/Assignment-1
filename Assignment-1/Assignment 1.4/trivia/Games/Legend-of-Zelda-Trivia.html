                        In the series , it might look like Link always defeats Ganon, but there are several games based on the premise that the Hero of Time 
                        (the Link from Ocarina of Time) is defeated by Ganon.
                        In fact, the first two games in the series (Legend of Zelda and Adventures of Link) actually take place in the timeline where the 
                        Hero of Time failed to defeat Ganon, thus dooming Hyrule to suffer under his rule.

                        Beloved actor and comedian Robin Williams, enjoyed the Legend of Zelda games so much that he named his daughter after the titular 
                        princess. His love of the series was so well-known that, after his death, fans petitioned Nintendo to memorialize him in one of the games.

                        The Triforce itself is a symbol rich with a history dating back to the 13th century. Originally known as the Mitsuuroko, 
                        it was adopted as the sigil of the powerful Hojo clan. The Hojos were a powerful family during the 12th and 13th century Japan.
