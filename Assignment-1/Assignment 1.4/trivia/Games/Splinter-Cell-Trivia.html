                        The game was literally banned in China for portraying China negatively (despite the Chinese villain being clearly established as a 
                        rogue general and Sam Fisher working to prove that the Chinese government and the main body of the PLA have nothing to do with 
                        Nikoladze's conspiracy, go figure). The decision was reverted a few years later.

                        Along with Knights of the Old Republic, Dead or Alive 3 and Ninja Gaiden, Splinter Cell was one of the biggest third-party exclusives for
                        the original Xbox, with Sam Fisher even becoming something of a mascot for the system.

                        The original version of Sam's character was for him to be a generic, cold-blooded killing machine. Michael Ironside demanded they change 
                        the character to make him more human and empathetic.
